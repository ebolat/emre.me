Data structures -as their name suggests- are *structures* which can hold some *data* together. They are one of the most important fundamental concepts in [Computer Science](https://emre.me/categories/#computer-science).
There are four *built-in* data structures in Python.

- [Lists](https://emre.me/data-structures/lists/)
- Tuples
- Sets
- [Dictionaries](https://emre.me/data-structures/hash-tables/)

I will introduce all of these built-in data structures in separate posts which can be reached by clicking the links above. Also, I will mention about frequently used data structures like,

- Arrays, NumPy Arrays, 2D Arrays and Matrices
- [Linked Lists](https://emre.me/data-structures/linked-lists/)
- [Stacks](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/)
- [Queues](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/)
- [Binary Trees](https://emre.me/data-structures/binary-tree/)
- [Heaps](https://emre.me/data-structures/heaps/)
- [Hash Tables](https://emre.me/data-structures/hash-tables/)
- Graphs

Let's take a tour of these data structures together.
