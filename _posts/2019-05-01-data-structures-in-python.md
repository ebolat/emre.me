Data structures -as their name suggests- are *structures* which can hold some *data* together. They are one of the most important fundamental concepts in [Computer Scince](https://emre.me/categories/#computer-science).
There are four *built-in* data structures in Python.

- [Lists](https://emre.me/data-structures/lists/)
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries

I will introduce all of these built-in data structures in separate posts which can be reached by clicking the links above. Also I will mention about frequently used data structures like,

- Arrays, NumPy Arrays, 2D Arrays and Matrices
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Trees
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

Let's take a tour of these data structures together. 

**Please click the individual links for the detailed information about each data structure**.
