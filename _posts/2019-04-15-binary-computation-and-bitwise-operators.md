If binary code is something only computers can understand, why should you learn about it?

As developers, we have our user friendly [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) to give instructions to computers but they are still translated into binary code for computers to be able to interpret them and run your programs.
 
Binary code is the most fundamental concept underlying programming and [Computer Science](https://emre.me/categories/#computer-science). But, how does binary work then? How can a complex computer program consist of only **1**’s and **0**’s?

## How does the binary number system works? ##

To be able to understand the [binary number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number), we need to take a closer look to the [decimal number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal) which we learn in elementary school and still using everyday.
Many numeral systems of ancient civilisations use ten and its powers for representing numbers, probably because there are ten fingers on two hands and people started counting by using their fingers.[<sup>1</sup>][1]

In the decimal system, each digit in a certain number represents the **1**’s, the **10**’s, the **100**’s, and so on, starting from the right hand side.

So, with the number “123”, for example, we have a 3 representing the **1**’s, a 2 representing the **10**’s, and finally a 1 to represent the **100**’s and total of them are 123.

We are starting from 10 to the power of 0 and increasing the powers while moving to left 1, 2, 3 and so on.

In the **binary system**, instead of using powers of 10, **we use powers of 2**.

In the binary system, each digit in a certain number represents the **1**’s, **2**’s, **4**’s, **8**’s, **16**’s, **32**’s, **64**’s, **128**’s, **256**’s and so on, starting from the right hand side.

Even though we do need a few more digits than we did with the decimal system, the binary system is just as good as the decimal system for displaying numbers.
Well, we are not limited to numbers, different types of information can also be represented in binary code, too! 

To be able to represent **text in binary code**, we can use simple numbers to represent the different letters in the alphabet. So, “A” could be “1”, “B” could be “2”, and so on.

Also, images and graphics displayed on your screen consists of pixels and each pixel in an image has **a numerical value** that determines the color it should display. This means that, we can represent images and graphics with binary code.
