In **[Coding Patterns](https://emre.me/categories/#coding-patterns)** series, we will try to *recognize* common patterns *underlying* behind each algorithm question, using real examples from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).

Previous posts were about [Sliding Window](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/sliding-window/), [Two Pointers](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/two-pointers/), [Fast & Slow Pointers](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/fast-slow-pointers/), [Merge Intervals](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/merge-intervals/), [Cyclic Sort](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/cyclic-sort/) and [In-place Reversal of a Linked List](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/in-place-reversal-of-a-linked-list/) patterns and today, we will introduce [Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/breadth-first-search/) pattern which is very useful to solve the problems involving traversal of a tree in a **level-by-level order**.

We will use a [Queue](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/#queues) to keep track of all the nodes of a level before we jump onto the next level. This also means that the space complexity of the algorithm will be **O(N)**, where **N** is the *maximum number of nodes* on any level.

## Problem: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal ##
{% capture notice %}
[**LeetCode 102 - Binary Tree Level Order Traversal** [*medium*]](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

**For example:**

Given binary tree [3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its level order traversal as:
```
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```

### Breadth First Search Solution ###

Since we need to traverse all nodes of each level before moving onto the next level, we can use the [Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/breadth-first-search/) technique to solve this problem.

We can use a [Queue](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/#queues) to efficiently traverse in BFS fashion. Here are the steps of our algorithm:

1. Start by pushing the `root` node to the [queue](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/#queues).
2. Keep iterating until the [queue](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/#queues) is empty.
3. In each iteration, first count the elements in the [queue](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/#queues) (letâ€™s call it `level_size`). We will have these many nodes in the current level.
4. Next, remove `level_size` nodes from the [queue](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/#queues) and push their `value` in an [array](https://emre.me/data-structures/lists/) to represent the current level.
5. After removing each node from the [queue](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/#queues), insert both of its children into the [queue](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/#queues).
6. If the [queue](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/#queues) is not empty, repeat from step **3** for the next level.

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List


class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None


class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        if root is None:
            return result

        queue = deque()
        queue.append(root)
        while queue:
            level_size = len(queue)
            current_level = []
            for _ in range(level_size):
                current_node = queue.popleft()
                current_level.append(current_node.val)  # add node to current level

                if current_node.left:
                    queue.append(current_node.left)
                if current_node.right:
                    queue.append(current_node.right)
            result.append(current_level)
        return result
```
**Time Complexity**: **O(N)** where **`N`** is the total number of nodes in the [tree](https://emre.me/data-structures/binary-tree/).

**Space Complexity**: **O(N)**, since we need an **O(N)** space to return the result. We will also need **O(N)** for the [queue](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/#queues).

## How to identify? ##

This approach is quite useful when dealing with the problems involving traversal of a tree in a **level-by-level order**.

When the problem asks the traversal of a tree, you should think about [Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/breadth-first-search/) pattern and using it in combination with the [Queue](https://emre.me/data-structures/stacks-and-queues/#queues) structure.
