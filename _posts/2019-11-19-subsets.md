In **[Coding Patterns](https://emre.me/categories/#coding-patterns)** series, we will try to *recognize* common patterns *underlying* behind each algorithm question, using real examples from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).

This pattern describes an efficient [Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/breadth-first-search/) approach to handle all these problems.

## Problem: Subsets ##
{% capture notice %}
[**LeetCode 78 - Subsets** [*medium*]](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

Given a set of *distinct* integers, `nums`, return all possible subsets (the power set).

Note: The solution set must **not** contain *duplicate* subsets.

**Example:**

**Input:** `nums` = [1,2,3]

**Output:**

### Subsets Solution ###

To generate all possible *subsets*, we can use the [Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/breadth-first-search/) approach. Starting with an empty set, we will iterate through all numbers one-by-one, and add them to *existing sets* to create *subsets*.

1. Start with an empty set: **[[ ]]**
2. Add `num` (**1**) to existing sets: [[ ], **[1]**]
3. Add `num` (**2**) to existing sets: [[ ], [1], **[2], [1, 2]**]
4. Add `num` (**3**) to existing sets: [[ ], [1], [2], [1, 2], **[3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]**]

![Subsets Example](https://cdn.emre.me/2019-11-19-subsets-example.png)

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        subsets = [[]]

        for num in nums:
            for i in range(len(subsets)):
                subsets.append(subsets[i] + [num])
        return subsets
```
**Time Complexity**: **O(2<sup>N</sup>)** since, in each step, number of subsets doubles.

**Space Complexity**: **O(2<sup>N</sup>)**

## How to identify? ##
If the problem description involves dealing with [Permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation) and [Combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) of a given set of elements or subsets, you should think about [Subsets](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/subsets/) pattern which is very useful to solve these kinds of problems.

This pattern describes an efficient [Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/breadth-first-search/) approach to handle all these problems.
