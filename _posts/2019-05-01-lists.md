In Python, when people are talking about *arrays*, they are generally referring to *lists*. However, there is a fundamental difference between them which can be explained as the items in an array need to be of the same type but there is no necessity like this in lists.

Lists are very flexible to use and they are the most versatile data structure in Python. Following are important terms to be able to understand the list concept in Python better.



- **Element**: Each *item* stored in a list is called an *element*.
- **Index**: Each location of an *element* in the list has a numerical index, which is used to identify the *element*.
