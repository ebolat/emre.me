In Python, when people are talking about *arrays*, they are generally referring to *lists*. However, there is a fundamental difference between them which can be explained as the items in an array need to be of the same type but there is no necessity like this in lists.

Lists are very flexible to use and they are the most versatile data structure in Python. Following are important terms to be able to understand the list concept in Python better.



- **Element**: Each *item* stored in a list is called an *element*.
- **Index**: Each location of an *element* in the list has a numerical index, which is used to identify the *element*.

## Creating a List ##
In Python, creating a list is as simple as placing all items inside a **square bracket** `[]` separated by **commas** `,`.

```python
# empty list
list_empty = []

# list of integers
list_ints = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# list of strings
list_strs = ['emre', 'dot', 'me']

# list of mixed data types
list_mixed = [1, 'emre.me', 5.73, True]

# nested list
list_nested = [['emre', 'dot', 'me'], [1], 5.73, True]

print("Empty list:", list_empty)
print("List of integers:", list_ints)
print("List of strings:", list_strs)
print("List of mixed data types:", list_mixed)
```

Output:
```
Empty list: []
List of integers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
List of strings: ['emre', 'dot', 'me']
List of mixed data types: [1, 'emre.me', 5.73, True]
Nested list: [['emre', 'dot', 'me'], [1], 5.73, True]
```

## Accessing Elements of a List ##

There are various ways which we can access the elements in a list. These are *index*, *negative index* and *slice*.

### Index / Negative Index ###

![emre.me index/negative index](https://cdn.emre.me/2019-05-01-lists-index-negative-index.png)

Index operator `[]` can be used to access an item in a list.
Index starts with **0** and a list having **7** elements like the string, **[emre.me](https://emre.me)** will have an index from **0** to **6**.

```python
# list
list_emre = ['e', 'm', 'r', 'e', '.', 'm', 'e']

print("1st element of the list is:", list_emre[0])
print("5th (last) element of the list is:", list_emre[-5])

# nested list
list_nested = ['emre', [1, 2, 3, [4]], False, 7.3, ['bolat']]

print("1st element of the list is:", list_nested[0])
print("1 in [1, 2, 3, [4]]:", list_nested[1][0])
print("4 in [1, 2, 3, [4]]:", list_nested[1][3][0])
print("False in the list:", list_nested[2])
print("a in 'bolat':", list_nested[-1][0][3])
```

Output:
```
1st element of the list is: e
5th (last) element of the list is: r

1st element of the list is: emre
1 in [1, 2, 3, [4]]: 1
4 in [1, 2, 3, [4]]: 4
False in the list: False
a in 'bolat': a
```

### Slicing Lists ###

![emre.me slicing](https://cdn.emre.me/2019-05-01-lists-slice.png)

Slicing in Python is very easy to understand. We are going to use Index operator again `[]` with `:` to be able to separate `start` and `stop` indexes.

```
[start:stop]  # items start through stop
[start:]      # items start through the rest of the list
[:stop]       # items from the beginning through stop
[:]           # a copy of the whole list
```

There is also the `step` value, which can be used with any of the above:

```
[start:stop:step]  # items start through stop, by step
```

The other feature is that `start` or `stop` may be a negative number, which means it counts from the end of the list instead of the beginning.

```
[-1]    # last item in the list
[-2:]   # last two items in the list
[:-2]   # everything except the last two items
```

Similarly, `step` may be a negative number:

```
[::-1]    # all items in the list, reversed
[1::-1]   # the first two items, reversed
[:-3:-1]  # the last two items, reversed
[-3::-1]  # everything except the last two items, reversed
```

So, let's try to summarize,

```python
list = ['e', 'm', 'r', 'e', '.', 'm', 'e']

# all items in the list
print(list[:])

# everything except first two items
print(list[2:])

# dot (.) of emre.me
print(list[4:5])

# all items except last three
print(list[:-3])

# reverse the list
print(list[::-1])
```

Output:

```
['e', 'm', 'r', 'e', '.', 'm', 'e']
['r', 'e', '.', 'm', 'e']
['.']
['e', 'm', 'r', 'e']
['e', 'm', '.', 'e', 'r', 'm', 'e']
```

### Add / Edit Elemets to a List ###

We can use assignment operator `=` to change an item or to change a range of items in a list.

```python
# create a list of numbers
list_nums = [0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5]

# change 4th item
list_nums[4] = 4

# Output: [0, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
print(list_nums)

# change 2nd to 4th item
list_nums[1:3] = [1, 2]

# Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(list_nums)
```
