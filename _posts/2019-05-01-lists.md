In Python, when people are talking about *arrays*, they are generally referring to *lists*. However, there is a fundamental difference between them which can be explained as the items in an array need to be of the same type but there is no necessity like this in lists.

Lists are very flexible to use and they are the most versatile data structure in Python. Following are important terms to be able to understand the list concept in Python better.



- **Element**: Each *item* stored in a list is called an *element*.
- **Index**: Each location of an *element* in the list has a numerical index, which is used to identify the *element*.

## Creating a List ##
In Python, creating a list is as simple as placing all items inside a **square bracket** `[]` separated by **commas** `,`.

```python
# empty list
list_empty = []

# list of integers
list_ints = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# list of strings
list_strs = ['emre', 'dot', 'me']

# list of mixed data types
list_mixed = [1, 'emre.me', 5.73, True]

# nested list
list_nested = [['emre', 'dot', 'me'], [1], 5.73, True]

print("Empty list:", list_empty)
print("List of integers:", list_ints)
print("List of strings:", list_strs)
print("List of mixed data types:", list_mixed)
```

Output:
```
Empty list: []
List of integers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
List of strings: ['emre', 'dot', 'me']
List of mixed data types: [1, 'emre.me', 5.73, True]
Nested list: [['emre', 'dot', 'me'], [1], 5.73, True]
```

## Accessing Elements of a List ##

There are various ways which we can access the elements in a list. These are *index*, *negative index* and *slice*.

### Index / Negative Index ###

Index operator `[]` can be used to access an item in a list.
Index starts with **0** and a list having **7** elements like the string, **[emre.me](https://emre.me)** will have an index from **0** to **6**.

```python
# list
list_emre = ['e', 'm', 'r', 'e', '.', 'm', 'e']

print("1st element of the list is:", list_emre[0])
print("5th (last) element of the list is:", list_emre[-5])

# nested list
list_nested = ['emre', [1, 2, 3, [4]], False, 7.3, ['bolat']]

print("1st element of the list is:", list_nested[0])
print("1 in [1, 2, 3, [4]]:", list_nested[1][0])
print("4 in [1, 2, 3, [4]]:", list_nested[1][3][0])
print("False in the list:", list_nested[2])
print("a in 'bolat':", list_nested[-1][0][3])
```

Output:
```
1st element of the list is: e
5th (last) element of the list is: r

1st element of the list is: emre
1 in [1, 2, 3, [4]]: 1
4 in [1, 2, 3, [4]]: 4
False in the list: False
a in 'bolat': a
```

### Slicing Lists ###
