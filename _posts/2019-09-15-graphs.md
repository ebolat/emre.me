[Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) is a branch of *Mathematics*, first introduced in **1736** when mathematician [Carl Ehler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gottlieb_Ehler) introduced [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) to the **Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem**[<sup>1</sup>](#references).

*The Seven Bridges of Königsberg* problem is based in the former **German** city of **Königsberg** (now [Kaliningrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaliningrad), **Russia**) which lays on both sides of the [Pregel River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregolya_River). 

In the center, there were **two** large islands which were connected to each other and to the riverbanks by **seven** bridges. [Carl Ehler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gottlieb_Ehler) became obsessed with finding *a route to walk through each of the seven bridges* without walking over any of them **more than once**. 

**Ehler** reached out to [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler), a **Swiss** mathematician. **Euler** confirmed **Ehler**’s hypothesis that the problem *did not have a solution*, and **Euler**’s explanation informed a new mathematical paradigm called **Geometry of Position**.

**Euler**’s new geometry paradigm stated that the location of the bridges didn’t matter. The problem, instead, can be simplified by turning each bridge into a **point** (*node*) with **lines** (*edges*) to represent links between them. This practice of using **nodes** and **edges** is now known as [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).

## Terminology ##
**Graph theory**, like any topic, has many specific *terms* for *aspects* of a graph.

</figure>

**Wow!** A lot of jargon. Lets try to understand what all of these terms mean.

### Vertex ###
A [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_%28graph_theory%29) (also called a **node**) is a fundamental part of a graph. It can have a name (a **key**), it may also have additional information (the **payload**).

Our graph has **6** vertices: 

`V = {a, b, c, d, e, f}`

### Edge ###
An [edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#edge) (also called an “**arc**”) is another fundamental part of a graph. An **edge** connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them.

Our graph has **8** edges: 

`E = {(a, b, 45), (a, c, 52), (a, d, 7), (b, c, 11), (b, f, 5), (d, e, 17), (e, f, 6), (f, c, 21)}`

### Directed or Undirected ###
In **directed** graphs, edges point *from the node at one end to the node at the other end*. In **undirected** graphs, the edges simply *connect the nodes at each end*.

Our example is a **directed graph**.

### Cyclic or Acyclic ###
A graph is **cyclic** if it has a cycle, *an unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or edges that connects back to itself*. Graphs *without* cycles are **acyclic**.

Our example is a **acyclic graph**.

![Cyclic / Acyclic Graphs](https://cdn.emre.me/2019-09-15-cyclic-acyclic-graphs.png){: .align-center}

### Weighted or Unweighted ###
If a graph is **weighted**, each *edge* has a "*weight*." The weight could, for example, represent the *distance* between two locations, or the *cost* or *time* it takes to travel between the locations.

## Representing Graphs in Code ##
There are a few ways to represent graphs in the code. We’ll look at the most common **three**, and the *basic tradeoffs*.

Let's take this graph as an example:

![Representing Graphs in Code](https://cdn.emre.me/2019-09-15-graph-code.png){: .align-center}

### Edge List ###
A list of all the edges in the graph:

```python
graph = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 5]]
```

Since node **0** has edges to nodes **1** and **2**, `[0, 1]` and `[0, 2]` are in the edge list.

This is well suited to *performant* **lookups of an edge**, or **listing all edges**, but is *slow* with many other query types. For example, *to find all vertices adjacent to a given vertex*, every edge must be examined.

### Adjacency List ###
A list where the **index** *represents the node* and the **value at that index** is a list of the *node's neighbors*:

```python
graph = [
    [1, 2],
    [0, 2],
    [0, 1, 3, 4],
    [2],
    [2, 5],
    [4]
]
```

Since node **2** has edges to nodes **0**, **1**, **3** and **4**, `graph[2]` has the adjacency list `[0, 1, 3, 4]`.

We could also use a dictionary where the **keys** *represent the node* and the **values** are the *lists of neighbors*.

```python
graph = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 2],
    2: [0, 1, 3, 4],
    3: [2],
    4: [2, 5],
    5: [4]
}
```

This would be useful if the nodes were represented by *strings*, *objects*, or otherwise didn't map cleanly to list indices.

This representation allows for **constant-time lookup of adjacent vertices**, which is useful in many *query* and *pathfinding* scenarios. 

It is *slower* for *edge lookups*, as the whole list of vertices adjacent to `u` must be examined for `v`, in order to find edge `uv`.

[Adjacency lists](#adjacency-list) are the typical choice for **general purpose** use, though [edge lists](#edge-list) or [adjacency matrices](#adjacency-matrix) have their own strengths, which may match a specific use case.

### Adjacency Matrix ###
A matrix of **0** and **1** indicating whether node *x* connects to node *y* (**0** means *no*, **1** means *yes*).

```python
graph = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]
```

Since node **4** has edges to nodes **2** and **5**, `graph[4][2]` and `graph[4][5]` have value **1**.

Adjacency matrices perform *strongly* with **edge lookups**, with a **constant-time lookup** given a pair of vertex `Id`. They tend to be *slow* for other operations. For example, *listing everything adjacent to a vertex* requires checking every single vertex in the graph.

They also *typically* **require more space than other models**, especially with *sparse graphs* (graphs with “*few*” edges).

## Implementation ##
Using [dictionaries](https://emre.me/data-structures/hash-tables/), it is easy to implement the *adjacency list* in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

```python
class Vertex:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.id = key
        self.connectedTo = {}

    def add_neighbor(self, nbr, weight=0):
        self.connectedTo[nbr] = weight

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.id) + ' connected to: ' + str([x.id for x in self.connectedTo])

    def get_connections(self):
        return self.connectedTo.keys()

    def get_id(self):
        return self.id

    def get_weight(self, nbr):
        return self.connectedTo[nbr]


class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertList = {}
        self.numVertices = 0

    def add_vertex(self, key):
        self.numVertices = self.numVertices + 1
        new_vertex = Vertex(key)
        self.vertList[key] = new_vertex
        return new_vertex

    def get_vertex(self, n):
        if n in self.vertList:
            return self.vertList[n]
        else:
            return None

    def __contains__(self, n):
        return n in self.vertList

    def add_edge(self, f, t, weight=0):
        if f not in self.vertList:
            nv = self.add_vertex(f)
        if t not in self.vertList:
            nv = self.add_vertex(t)
        self.vertList[f].add_neighbor(self.vertList[t], weight)

    def get_vertices(self):
        return self.vertList.keys()

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.vertList.values())
```
