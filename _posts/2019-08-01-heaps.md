The word *heap* is used in a couple of different context in [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science). A heap is sometimes refers to an area in the memory which is used for dynamic memory allocation. Another meaning, and the topic of this article, is a [data structure](https://emre.me/data-structures/data-structures-in-python/) which is very useful and important.

Famous search algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm[<sup>1</sup>](#references) and some reinforcement learning techniques like Hidden Markov Model (HMM)[<sup>2</sup>](#references) which is especially known for its application in pattern recognition (speech, handwriting, gesture recognition) uses the heap.

## What is a Heap? ##

A heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a *complete* [Binary Tree](https://emre.me/data-structures/binary-tree/) in which each level has all of its nodes. The exception to this is the bottom level of the tree, which we fill in from left to right.

It is called;
- **Min Heap**, if each parent node is *less than or equal to* its child node
- **Max Heap**, if each parent node is *greater than or equal to* its child node

The heap above is called a **Min Heap** since, each value of nodes is less than or equal to the value of child nodes.

## Representation ##

We can represent a heap as an array like this;

![Heap Representation as an Array](https://cdn.emre.me/2019-08-01-heap-array.png){: .align-center}

- Root node, *i = 0* is the first item of the array
- A parent node, *parent(i) = (i-1) / 2*
- A left child node, *left(i) = 2i + 1*
- A right child node, *right(i) = 2i + 2*

For example, 

- Parent node of **33** is, *parent(7) = (7-1) / 2 = 3* so, *i = 3* is **14**
- Left child node of **11** is, *left(2) = (2 x 2) + 1 = 5* so, *i = 5* is **19**
- Right child node of **14** is, *right(3) = (2 x 3) + 2 = 8* so, *i = 8* is **17**

## Implementation ##

We need to implement two different methods in order to build a heap from an array. These methods are `min_heapify()` to make some node and its descendant nodes meet the min heap property and `build_min_heap()` to produce a heap from an arbitrary array.

We can build a min heap by applying `min_heapify()` repeatedly.

### `min_heapify()` and `build_min_heap()` ###

```python
def get_left_child(i):
    return 2 * i + 1


def get_right_child(i):
    return 2 * i + 2


def min_heapify(arr, i):
    left = get_left_child(i)
    right = get_right_child(i)
    smallest = i

    if left < len(arr) and arr[i] > arr[left]:
        smallest = left
    if right < len(arr) and arr[smallest] > arr[right]:
        smallest = right
    if smallest != i:
        arr[i], arr[smallest] = arr[smallest], arr[i]
        min_heapify(arr, smallest)
```

and now we can repeatedly call `min_heapify()` function in order to build a **Min Heap**.

```python
def build_min_heap(arr):
    for i in reversed(range(len(arr)//2)):
        min_heapify(arr, i)
```

### `max_heapify()` and `build_max_heap()` ###

```python
def max_heapify(arr, i):
    left = get_left_child(i)
    right = get_right_child(i)
    largest = i

    if left < len(arr) and arr[left] > arr[largest]:
        largest = left
    if right < len(arr) and arr[right] > arr[largest]:
        largest = right
    if largest != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]
        max_heapify(arr, largest)
```

and now we can repeatedly call `max_heapify()` function in order to build a **Max Heap**.

```python
def build_max_heap(arr):
    for i in reversed(range(len(arr)//2)):
        max_heapify(arr, i)
```
